# Introduction to translating between Python and R
Materials for RCC workshop "Introduction to translating between Python and R"

<b> Abstract:</b></br>
Python, a top choice for data-science and machine-learning projects, is now in second spot behind C in Tiobe's latest index, knocking Java down into third place. It is a general purpose and high level programming language that is used to develop desktop GUI applications, websites and web applications. Also, Python allows programmers to focus on core functionality of the application by taking care of common programming tasks. On the other hand, the R computing environment has become one of the most important tools in quantitative research, from computational biology to financial modeling.  

People in data science are split between Python advocates and R enthusiasts. Rather than declaring a side, anyone who has learned one of these languages should capitalize on the advantage and dive into the other. There are infinite parallels between Python and R, and you can solve challenges in the best way possible rather than limiting yourself to half of the tool shed. This workshop will guide participants to connect R and Python for easy translation between the two. Through the connections, repeatedly interacting with the new language, and contextualizing with projects, anyone who understands either Python or R can quickly begin programming in the other.

<b> Objectives:</b></br>
During the workshop participants will be able to learn or do:
* The major difference between Python and R
* Looking at the basics of Python and R side-by-side
* An exercise of online translating a given R script into Python and vice versa
* A practice of executing R from Python and vice versa

<b> Level:</b></br>
Introduction/ Intermediate

<b> Duration:</b></br>
2 hours

<b> Prerequisites:</b></br>
All participants are expected to use a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system that they have administrative privileges on and ensure internet availability. Having prior programming experience in Python and/ or R is helpful and encouraging. An RCC account is helpful but not required.
